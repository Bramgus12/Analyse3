**Read the whole file carefully, Please!!**

To use this library you have to follow these steps.
First you have to run the file PLS.py. When you run this file, in the console, you can now see that you can enter
commands into the console. Here are the commands that you are able to use (Everything is whithout the ""):

* "make_loan" to make a loan. You have to enter the FULL title. It is case sensitive.
* "search_book" to search for the book that is in the database.
* "search_customer" to search for a customer in the database.
* "append_book" to add a book to the database.
* "append_customer" to add a customer to the database.
* "add_new_customer_file" to use another csv file with customers.
* "backup" to backup the database to a file called backup.json.
* "restore_backup" to restore a backup from the file backup.json to the files customers.json and books.json
* "exit" to exit the file. You have to run the PLS.py file again to start the library system.

To use another Customer file in the Public Library System, you have to add it to the same folder as the PLS.py file and
call it customers.csv, than use the "add_new_customer_file" command. The books must be stored in the books.json file and it must exist in the folder where also PLS.py is saved. The file
customers.json also has to exist in that folder.
